# Chinese Investment Database Project

This project aims to build a database that keeps track of various Chinese investment projects. This data will ultimately be used to track public opinion on China in the locations where these projects take place. The project can be broken down into 3 main stages of development.

- Data Ingestion / Wrangling
- Backend
- Frontend

We aim to allow users to look at different investment companies, projects, and even specific investments to see how public sentiment about China is affected in certain geographic locations.
